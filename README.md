# Stock Market Prediction Using LSTM with Explainable AI

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based deep learning model to predict HDFC Bank stock prices using historical data. It learns temporal dependencies and forecasts future prices accurately. To enhance transparency, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to interpret model predictions.

## ðŸš€ Features
- ðŸ“ˆ Data extraction from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`
- ðŸ§¹ Data preprocessing with MinMaxScaler
- ðŸ§  Deep learning model using stacked LSTM layers
- ðŸ“Š Evaluation metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, RÂ² Score
- ðŸ“‰ Forecast visualization for next 10 and 30 days
- ðŸ§¾ Model explainability using SHAP and waterfall and bar plots
